### 4. 🚨 Crisis Response System ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING
**Status**: System operational but has authentication/authorization issues

#### ✅ WORKING FEATURES:
- **Alert Generation**: ✅ Demo crisis triggers work
  ```
  GET /api/v1/crisis/crisis/demo/trigger/cybersecurity
  → Successfully created alert: demo_cybersecurity_1750826065.444878
  ```
- **Alert Retrieval**: ✅ Active alerts endpoint functional
  ```
  GET /api/v1/crisis/crisis/alerts
  → Returns active alerts array with full details
  ```
- **Alert Details**: ✅ Individual alert lookup works
- **Crisis Types**: ✅ Supports 10 crisis types (cybersecurity, financial, operational, etc.)
- **Severity Levels**: ✅ 5 severity levels (low → catastrophic)

#### ❌ BLOCKED FEATURES:
- **Alert Acknowledgment**: ❌ HTTP 403 Forbidden - CSRF protection active
- **Response Initiation**: ❌ Likely same CSRF issue
- **Response Updates**: ❌ Needs authentication bypass
- **Crisis Resolution**: ❌ POST endpoints blocked

#### 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
1. **CSRF Protection**: Server responds with "CSRF token required"
2. **Authentication**: POST endpoints require proper auth headers
3. **Router Path Issue**: Fixed duplicate `/crisis/crisis/` path structure
4. **Security Middleware**: Rate limiting and security headers active

#### 🛠️ IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:
1. **Disable CSRF for testing** or implement proper token handling
2. **Add authentication bypass** for demo/testing endpoints
3. **Implement proper API authentication** for crisis management workflows
