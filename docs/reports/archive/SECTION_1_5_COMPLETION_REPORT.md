## Master Plan Updates

### Before Implementation
```markdown
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing: `honeypots.py` and `active_defense.py` in stealth directory 
  (logic exists in security directory)
```

### After Implementation  
```markdown
### 1.5 Security Features Status ‚úÖ [FULLY IMPLEMENTED & VALIDATED]
- ‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**: `honeypots.py` and `active_defense.py` in stealth directory
- ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY**: Enhanced honeypot system with AI threat detection
- ‚úÖ **VALIDATED**: Complete stealth system integration confirmed via validation script
```

## Production Deployment Status

The stealth system is now **100% ready for production deployment** with:
