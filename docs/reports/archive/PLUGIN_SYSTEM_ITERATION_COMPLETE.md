## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Plugin Architecture
```python
# Dynamic Plugin Loading
plugin_manager = EnhancedPluginManager()
await plugin_manager.initialize()

# Smart Optimization Discovery  
optimizations = await plugin_manager.get_all_optimizations(context)

# Plugin Execution with Monitoring
result = await plugin_manager.execute_optimization(
    plugin_id="banking_optimization",
    optimization_id="transaction_processing",
    context={"compliance": ["pci_dss", "sox"]}
)
```

### Configuration Management
```json
{
  "plugin_id": "banking_optimization",
  "name": "Banking Industry Optimization",
  "category": "industry",
  "status": "enabled",
  "priority": 2,
  "dependencies": [],
  "configuration": {
    "compliance": {
      "pci_dss_required": true,
      "sox_compliance": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
# Plugin Metrics Collection
metrics = plugin_manager.get_plugin_metrics("banking_optimization")
print(f"Executions: {metrics.total_executions}")
print(f"Success Rate: {metrics.successful_executions / metrics.total_executions:.1%}")
print(f"Average Time: {metrics.average_execution_time_ms:.1f}ms")
```
